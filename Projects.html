<p>Throughout my first semester in the IDD Program, I have especially enjoyed learning how to use Adobe! </p>
<h3>Adobe Creations</h3>

<img src="images/Wild Home.png" alt="A white house with trees around it in the fall time. There are two large pumkins at the left front of the house. The one on the left is red, and the one on the right is orange. On the front right of the image, there is an very large Kit Kat bar with reeses peanut butter cups beside it. On the roof of the house is a giant black cat stretched out. A small dog is at the door step with a white sheet over it's head - like a ghost. Walking up to the house a minion with his back facing the viewer."

<h4>Wild Home</h4>
<p> In this project, I used Adobe Photoshop to paste and cut out the different images onto the house.</p>

<img src="images/Identity Portfolio.png" alt="A giant M and B writen in a simple cursive style. In small letters underneath and M and B, are the words Classy. Elegant. Confident. These small words have a line under them. The whole display is in a dark navy blue with a white background."

<h4>Identity Portfolio</h4>
<p>This assingment was focused on typography and creating a style using a part of your name. I chose my first and last initials and edited a cursive font on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<img src="images/Sky.png" alt="An image of a valley with a small mountian in the middle. The land is in a yellow/green light. The top left of the sky is a light blue that fades into a dark purple. The bottom left of the sky is yellow and fades across to the bottom right in an oragne/red."

<h4>Sky</h4>
<p>This assingment used Adobe Photoshop to edit the image however I pleased. I changed the hue of the image and created the colourful lighting in the image.</p>
